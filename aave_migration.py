AAVE, the money marklet protocl has seen, so far, three seperate versions. These are v1, v2, and AAVE AMM.
Today We will look at selected dates with selected coins (stables), when v2 launched incentives (in stkAAVE) in April 2021, stuff began to change, and funds were moved around
The Two metrics are as follows:
Total Supply, The amount of deposits in the protocol
TVL, The amount supplied MINUS the borrowed amount. This is roughly the avalible (borrowable) liquidity.
